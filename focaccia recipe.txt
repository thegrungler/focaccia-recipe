Let the dough sit another 30 minutes, uncovered
Preheat oven to 410 degrees fahrenheit, 210 celcius
Flatten and spread the dough out, covering the baking sheet
“Mix” olive oil and water and evenly coat the surface of the dough
Add spices (salt and aromatics are good, but spice as you like)
Bake for 15 minutes, adding cheese towards the end if you desire
Let cool, cut into squares, and serve
